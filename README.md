# Natural-Language-to-SQL-Query-Generation-Using-Transformer-Architecture-
# 🧠 Natural Language to SQL Query Generator

A Transformer-based system that converts natural language into SQL queries and provides intuitive data visualizations using an interactive GUI. This project simplifies data interaction for non-technical users by bridging the gap between human language and database systems.
